The web application allows users to check the current weather for a location by making asynchronous requests to the OpenWeatherMap API. Users can enter a location (city or ZIP code), choose a temperature unit (Celsius or Fahrenheit), and click the "Get Weather" button. The application displays the weather information, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather description. Error cases, such as the location not found, are handled gracefully with user-friendly error messages. The program is styled for a visually appealing and responsive user experience.The web application allows users to check the current weather for a location by making asynchronous requests to the OpenWeatherMap API.
